# NHS_Capacity_and_Resource_Utilisation_Python
ðŸ“Š NHS Healthcare Utilisation & Capacity Analysis
As part of a data analytics team contracted by the National Health Service (NHS) in England, our objective was to analyze internal and external datasets to address key questions related to service utilisation, missed appointments, and the potential value of external data sources (e.g., social media data from X, formerly Twitter).

ðŸŽ¯ Project Scope
The NHS is facing increasing pressure to expand its infrastructure in response to a growing population. However, stakeholder opinions are dividedâ€”some advocate for expansion, while others believe existing infrastructure can be optimized with better resource utilization. Our role involved:

Refining high-level business questions into actionable analytical questions.

Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on provided datasets.

Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in healthcare service usage.

Assessing the relevance and potential insights from external data (e.g., Twitter/X).

Delivering data-driven insights and strategic recommendations to inform NHS budgeting and infrastructure planning.

This analysis supports informed decision-making around whether to scale NHS capacity or improve the efficiency of current operations.
